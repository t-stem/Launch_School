/*
A grocery store uses a JavaScript function to calculate discounts on various items. 
They are testing out various percentage discounts but are getting unexpected results. 
Go over the code, and identify the reason why they aren't getting the expected discounted prices from the function. 
Then, modify the code so that it produces the correct results.

    let discountedPrice = this.price - discount;// it's because the price in the object itself is discounted due to the code >this.price -= discount;<. That means that the second discount will use the first discounted price as an input. 
    
    return discountedPrice; // this.price; returning this.price after updating this.price repeatedly will lead to the wrong output after when the function is run repeatedly
