/*
Since a constructor is just a function, you can call it without the new operator. 
However, that can lead to unexpected results and errors, especially for inexperienced programmers. 
Write a constructor function that you can use with or without the new operator. 
The function should return the same result with either form. 
Use the code below to check your solution:
*/

function User(first, last) {
  if (!(this instanceof User)) {
    return new User(first, last);
  } else {
    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
    this.name = this.first + ' ' + this.last;
  }  
}



let name = 'Jane Doe';
let user1 = new User('John', 'Doe');
let user2 = User('John', 'Doe');

console.log(name);         // => Jane Doe
console.log(user1.name);   // => John Doe
console.log(user2.name);   // => John Doe
