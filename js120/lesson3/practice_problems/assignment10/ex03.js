/*
Write a constructor function called Circle that takes a radius as an argument. 
You should be able to call an area method on any objects created by the constructor to get the circle's area. 
Test your implementation with the following code:
*/

function Circle(radius) {
  this.radius = radius;
}

Circle.prototype.area = function() {
  return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
}

let a = new Circle(3);
let b = new Circle(4);

console.log(a.area().toFixed(2)); // => 28.27
console.log(b.area().toFixed(2)); // => 50.27
console.log(a.hasOwnProperty('area')); // => false
