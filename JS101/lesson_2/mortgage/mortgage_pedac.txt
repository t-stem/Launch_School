Take everything that you've learned so far and build a mortgage calculator 
(or car payment calculator -- it's the same thing) that determines the monthly payment assuming 
that interest is compounded monthly.

Understand the Problem:
Identify expected input and output
-> Inputs: 
   the loan amount in $ with two decimals
   the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) in percent with 100 being 100%
   the loan duration in years
-> Outputs:
   print the monthly payment amount as a dollar and cents amount, e.g., $123.45 or $371.00.
-> When you write your program, don't use the single-letter variables m, p, j, and n; 
   use explicit names. For instance, you may want to use loanAmount instead of p.

Make the requirements explicit
-> build a mortgage calculator (or car payment calculator -- it's the same thing) 
-> the calculator determines the monthly payment
-> interest is compounded monthly

Identify rules
-> m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j) ** -n ) )
   where:
   m = monthly payment
   p = loan amount
   j = monthly interest rate
   n = loan duration in months

Mental model of the problem (optional)

Examples/Test Case: Validate understanding of the problem
-> loanUSD < 0
-> loanUSD === 0
-> loanUSD === 'askjfalsf'
-> loanUSD === undefined
-> loanUSD === null
-> loanUSD === ''
-> loanUSD === ' '
-> loanYears < 0
-> loanYears === 0
-> loanYears === 'sldflskfj'
-> loanYears === undefined
-> loanYears === null
-> loanYears === '' 
-> loanYears === ' '
-> APR < 0
-> APR === 0 (zero-interest loans)
-> APR === 'askjfalsf'
-> APR === undefined
-> APR === null
-> APR === ''
-> APR === ' '
-> standard case (in line with https://www.calculator.net/loan-calculator.html):
   loanUSD = 100000
   loanYears = 10
   APR = 6
-> loans that aren't for an integer number of years

Data Structure: How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output.
-> loan amount: number
-> APR: number
-> loan duration: number
-> no data structures needed

Algorithm: Steps for converting input to output
-> compute monthly interest rate (APR / 12)
-> compute loan duration in months (years * 12), must be an integer (use floor)
-> compute monthly payment using the formula

Code:
