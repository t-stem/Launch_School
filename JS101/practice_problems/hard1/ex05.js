/*
Ben was tasked to write a simple JavaScript function to determine whether an input string
 is an IP address using 4 dot-separated numbers, e.g., 10.4.5.11. 
He is not familiar with regular expressions.

Alyssa supplied Ben with a function named isAnIpNumber. 
It determines whether a string is a numeric string between 0 and 255 as required for IP numbers
 and asked Ben to use it. Here's the code that Ben wrote:
*/ 

function isAnIpNumber(str) {
  if (/^\d+$/.test(str)) {
    let number = Number(str);
    return number >= 0 && number <= 255;
  }

  return false;
}

function isDotSeparatedIpAddress(inputString) {
  let dotSeparatedWords = inputString.split(".");
  if (dotSeparatedWords.length !== 4) {
    return false;
  }

  while (dotSeparatedWords.length > 0) {
    let word = dotSeparatedWords.pop();
    if (!isAnIpNumber(word)) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

/*
Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and said, "It's a good start, but you missed a few things. 
You're not returning a false condition, and you're not handling the case when the input 
string has more or less than 4 components, e.g., 4.5.5 or 1.2.3.4.5: both those values should be invalid." */

console.log(isDotSeparatedIpAddress("10.4.5.11"));
console.log(isDotSeparatedIpAddress("10.4.5."));
