// Alan wrote the following function, which was intended to return all of the factors of number:

function factors(number) {
  let divisor = number;
  let factors = [];
  do {
    if (number % divisor === 0) {
      factors.push(number / divisor);
    }
    divisor -= 1;
  } while (divisor !== 0);
  return factors;
}

// Alyssa noticed that this code would fail when the input is 0 or a negative number, 
// and asked Alan to change the loop. How can he make this work without using a do/while loop? 

// Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, 
// but we want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

// Bonus: What is the purpose of number % divisor === 0 in that code?

function revisedFactors(number) {
  let factors = [];
  if (number <= 0) {
    console.log("Can' find factors of numbers smaller than or equal to 0.");
  } else {
    for (let i = 1; i <= number; i += 1) {
      if (number % i === 0) {factors.push(i)}
    }
  }
  return factors;
}

console.log(revisedFactors(0));
