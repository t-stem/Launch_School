A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is an odd number that is a multiple of 7, 
with all of its digits occurring exactly once each. For example, 49 is a featured number, but 98 is not (it is not odd), 
97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).

Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns the next featured number greater than the integer. 

Issue an error message if there is no next featured number.

NOTE: The largest possible featured number is 9876543201.


# PROBLEM
## Inputs
- integer argument

## Outputs
- return the next featured number greater than the integer
- issue an error message if there is no next featured number

## Explicit rules
- A featured number is 
  * **an odd number**
  * **a multiple of 7**
  * with all of its digits occurring exactly once each. 
- The largest possible featured number is 9876543201.

## Implicit rules
- **if input > 9876543201 it's not a featured number**
- **if a digit occurs more than once it's not a featured number**

# EXAMPLES/TEST CASES
featured(12);           // 21
featured(20);           // 21
featured(21);           // 35
featured(997);          // 1029
featured(1029);         // 1043
featured(999999);       // 1023547
featured(999999987);    // 1023456987
featured(9876543186);   // 9876543201
featured(9876543200);   // 9876543201
featured(9876543201);   // "There is no possible number that fulfills those requirements."

# DATA STRUCTURES
- array of digits

# ALGORITHM
SET currentNumber = inputNumber + 1;

WHILE isFeatured(currentNumber) is false
  currentNumber += 1;

RETURN currentNumber


isFeatured(thisNumber) 
IF thisNumber % 2 equals 0 (thisNumber is not odd)
  RETURN false

IF thisNumber % 7 equals 1 (thisNumber is not a multiple of 7)
  RETURN false

IF duplicateDigits is true (thisNumber has duplicate digits)
  RETURN false

ELSE (this number is odd, is a multiple of seven and has no duplicate digits)
  RETURN true

duplicateDigits(number) 
SET digitCounts = object with digits 0-9 as keys and their respective counts (all set to 0) as values

SET currentNumber = number
SET BASE = 10

WHILE currentNumber > 0
  currentDigit = currentNumber % BASE
  IF count of currentDigit in digitCounts equals 1 (digit already occurs in the number)
    RETURN true
  count for currentDigit in digitCounts += 1;
  currentNumber = (currentNumber - currentDigit) / BASE

RETURN false (number doesn't have any duplicate digits)
