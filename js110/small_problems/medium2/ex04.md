Some people believe that Fridays that fall on the 13th day of the month are unlucky days. 

Write a function that takes a year as an argument and returns the number of Friday the 13ths in that year. 

You may assume that the year is greater than 1752, which is when the United Kingdom adopted the modern Gregorian Calendar.

You may also assume that the same calendar will remain in use for the foreseeable future.


# PROBLEM
## Inputs
- integer argument: year

## Outputs
- integer: the number of Friday the 13ths in the input year

## Explicit rules
- assume that the year is greater than 1752
- assume that the same calendar will remain in use for the foreseeable future

## Implicit rules
- account for leap years

- starting year is 1753
- starting date is 1/1/1753 

- the days that are meant to counted have to be both fridays and 13th of the month

## Questions


# EXAMPLES/TEST CASES
fridayThe13ths(2017);      // 2
fridayThe13ths(1986);      // 1
fridayThe13ths(2015);      // 3

# DATA STRUCTURES
- Date objects


# ALGORITHM
SET inputYear = function argument
SET firstOfJan = first day of the year

SET currentDay = firstDayOfYear
WHILE currentDay is not a Friday
  IF currentDay is a Friday
    SET firstFriday = currentDay
    END
  ELSE increase currentDay by 1

SET currentDay = firstFriday
SET iterator = 7
WHILE currentDay is within inputYear
  ADD currentDay to fridaysArray 
  currentday += iterator days

SET counter = 0
WHILE days left in fridaysArray
  SET currentDay = current array element
  IF day of currentDay is 13th
    counter += 1

RETURN counter
