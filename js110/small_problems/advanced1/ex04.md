let matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6],
];

A 90-degree rotation of a matrix produces a new matrix in which each side of the matrix is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees. For example, the 90-degree rotation of the matrix shown above is:

3  4  1
9  7  5
6  2  8

Write a function that takes an arbitrary MxN matrix, rotates it clockwise by 90-degrees as described above, and returns the result as a new matrix. The function should not mutate the original matrix.


# PROBLEM
## Inputs
- an arbitrary MxN matrix
  * an array with three nested arrays
  * each nested array represents a row

## Outputs
- a new matrix
  * rotated version of the original MxN matrix clockwise by 90-degrees

## Explicit rules
- The function should not mutate the original matrix.

## Implicit rules
- first row should be reversed and moved to the first column
- second row should be reversed and moved to second column
- third row should be reversed and moved to second column
- row N should be reversed nd moved to column M

# EXAMPLES/TEST CASES
let matrix1 = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6],
];

let matrix2 = [
  [3, 7, 4, 2],
  [5, 1, 0, 8],
];

let newMatrix1 = rotate90(matrix1);
let newMatrix2 = rotate90(matrix2);
let newMatrix3 = rotate90(rotate90(rotate90(rotate90(matrix2))));

console.log(newMatrix1);      // [[3, 4, 1], [9, 7, 5], [6, 2, 8]]
console.log(newMatrix2);      // [[5, 3], [1, 7], [0, 4], [8, 2]]
console.log(newMatrix3);      // `matrix2` --> [[3, 7, 4, 2], [5, 1, 0, 8]]

# DATA STRUCTURES
- Output:
  * Nested array
  * Outer array represents matrix
  * Inner arrays represent rows in the matrix

# ALGORITHM
- Outer loop (loop through columns of inputMatrix) 
  - Create a new row in outputMatrix
  - Inner loop (loop through elements in columns of inputMatrix)
    * Add column elements from inputMatrix to row in outputMatrix
  - Reverse new row in outputMatrix
