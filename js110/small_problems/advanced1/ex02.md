/* A 3x3 matrix can be represented by an array of arrays: 
an outer array containing three subarrays that each contain three elements.
 For example, the 3x3 matrix shown below:

1  5  8
4  7  2
3  9  6

*/

let matrix = [
  [1, 5, 8],
  [4, 7, 2],
  [3, 9, 6],
];

/*
The transpose of a 3x3 matrix is the matrix that results from exchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix. 
For example, the transposition of the matrix shown above is:

1  4  3
5  7  9
8  2  6

*/


/*
Write a function that takes an array of arrays that represents a 3x3 matrix and returns the transpose of the matrix. You should implement the function on your own, without using any external libraries.

Take care not to modify the original matrix — your function must produce a new matrix and leave the input matrix array unchanged.

# PROBLEM
## Inputs
- array of nested arrays that represents a 3x3 matrix

## Outputs
- returns the transpose of the matrix (exchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix)
- your function must produce a new matrix and leave the input matrix array unchanged

# EXAMPLES/TEST CASES


# DATA STRUCTURES
- Arrays


# ALGORITHM
_ Swap index positions
- Inner and outer loop
- Matrix[rowIndex][columnIndex] should become newMatrix[columnIndex][rowIndex]

SET oldMatrix = input matrix
SET newMatrix = empty array
SET first, second and third elements of newMatrix = empty array

SET rowIndex = 0
WHILE rowIndex < 3
  SET columnIndex = 0
  WHILE columnIndex < 3
    newMatrix[columnIndex][rowIndex] = oldMatrix[rowIndex][columnIndex];
RETURN newMatrix
